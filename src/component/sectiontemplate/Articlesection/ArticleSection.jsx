                "In 2023, global energy consumption reached 17,200 TWh. This incredible demand underlines the importance of exploring clean and sustainable energy solutions, like nuclear energy, particularly for developed economies.",
                "Countries with robust nuclear energy infrastructure are contributing significantly to global clean energy generation. These regions continue to invest heavily in the expansion of nuclear energy capacity, ensuring that nuclear power remains a critical component of the clean energy future.",
                "For this graphic, the first in the three-part Fueling the Future series, Visual Capitalist partnered with Global X ETFs to explore nuclear energy generation further, determine which regions generated the most nuclear energy in 2023, and investigate why nuclear is critical to the clean energy transition."
