    des: ["Tesla Inc., founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003 and later significantly shaped by Elon Musk, represents a transformative force in the automotive and energy sectors. What began as a niche startup, with an ambitious vision of creating electric cars accessible to the masses, has evolved into a multinational powerhouse. Tesla's key to success lies in its vertically integrated business model, which distinguishes it from traditional automakers. By keeping design, manufacturing, and even parts production largely in-house, Tesla not only reduces costs but also rapidly innovates. This model facilitates swift adaptation to new technological advancements and market demands, effectively condensing the typical automotive industry's lethargic timelines. Tesla's operations span across designing and producing electric vehicles—such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y—along with energy solutions including solar panels and energy storage products like the Powerwall and Powerpack.",

        "Tesla's financial engine is driven primarily by its automotive sales, but it bolsters this with diverse revenue streams. In addition to selling vehicles outright, they offer leasing options, yielding recurring revenue. Another cornerstone is their software prowess, particularly in autonomous driving technology and vehicle connectivity, which continually attracts consumer interest and corporate partnerships.
